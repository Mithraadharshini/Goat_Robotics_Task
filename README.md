# Autonomous Robot Navigation Simulation

** Features
Pathfinding with A*: The robot uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path while adhering to movement constraints.

Dynamic Environment: Obstacles are updated randomly during the simulation, requiring real-time path replanning.

Visualization:
The robot, obstacles, and path are visualized on a grid.
The planned path is displayed dynamically, updating with every step.
Collision Avoidance: The robot ensures safe distances from obstacles and recalculates paths as needed.

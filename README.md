# Autonomous Robot Navigation Simulation

** Features** <br>
**Pathfinding with A***: The robot uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path while adhering to movement constraints.

**Dynamic Environment**: Obstacles are updated randomly during the simulation, requiring real-time path replanning.

**Visualization:**
The robot, obstacles, and path are visualized on a grid.
The planned path is displayed dynamically, updating with every step.
Collision Avoidance: The robot ensures safe distances from obstacles and recalculates paths as needed.

**Install Dependencies** <br>
pip install pygame

**Run the Simulation:** <br>
python3 GridRobotics.py <br>
python3 RoboticMovement.py<br>
